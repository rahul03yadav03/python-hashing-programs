# HASHLIB – Hashing & Integrity

This project demonstrates the use of Python’s built-in `hashlib` module for hashing
and data integrity verification.

## Objectives

- Learn how hashing works in Python
- Generate hashes for text, passwords, and files
- Verify data integrity using hash comparison

## Tasks Implemented

1. Calculate MD5 hash of user input text
2. Generate SHA-1 hash of a string
3. Generate SHA-256 hash of a password
4. Hash a file using MD5
5. Compare two strings using hashes
6. Generate SHA-512 hash of a file
7. Create a function `hash_text(text)` that returns SHA-256
8. Check if two files have identical hashes
9. Detect file modification using hash comparison
10. Store filenames and their hash values in a dictionary

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- hashlib module (built-in)

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in VS Code  
2. Open the Python file you want to run  
3. Open Terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + `)  
4. Run the file using the command:  python <your_file_name>.py
